# Chatbot-using-NLTK
Introduction
This project is a basic chatbot built with Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot uses a predefined set of patterns and responses to interact with users in natural language. Unlike advanced AI chatbots that rely on deep learning models, this one is rule-based and works by matching user inputs with regular expressions.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a chatbot can be developed using simple NLP techniques and provide a foundation for beginners to explore conversational AI.

Uses
Interactive chatbot for basic conversations (greetings, questions, jokes, fun facts).
Can be extended to act as a FAQ bot for websites or applications.
Useful for beginners in NLP to understand how pattern matching works.
Demonstrates NLTK’s Chat utility for building conversational agents.

Technologies Used
Python → Core programming language.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) → Used for chatbot framework (nltk.chat.util.Chat).
Regex (pattern matching) → Matches user inputs to predefined responses.

Conclusion
This project highlights how rule-based chatbots work and how they can be implemented using simple tools like NLTK in Python. While this chatbot is limited to predefined patterns and cannot handle real-world complexity, it serves as a great starting point for beginners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and chatbot development.
